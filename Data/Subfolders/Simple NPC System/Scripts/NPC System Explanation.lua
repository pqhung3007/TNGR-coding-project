--												Simple NPC System Explanation Sheet
--												-----------------------------------
--	
--						1.	Use of the NPC system
--
--						The NPC System can be used for crowding the public places in your game, for example parts
--						of a city or in bigger indoor facilities. I'd recommended to not use the NPCs in narrow
--						spaces as they tend to get stuck for a long time there. The NPCs are coded for also adjusting
--						to terrain that is not completely even, but the best visual results are archieved with even terrain.
--
--						2.	Setup of the NPCs
--						
--						To begin with, place the template of a NPC ("NPC Man" or "NPC Woman") in your world. Place them with
--						their shoes a little above the ground. In the properties of the NPC, you can customize the clothing of
--						your NPC. If you scroll further down you will also have three options for the NPC:
--
--						- SocialNPC: 	Decide if the NPCs will talk to each other if they meet on their ways. You can also 
--									 	customize the "NPCTrigger" size to fit the social range you want to archieve.
--
--						- EmotionalConversation:	Enable for more emotional animations while the NPCs talk. Has to be enabled
--													for the talking sounds to be heard.
--
--						- TalkingSounds: 	Turn on/off the talking sounds during a meeting of two NPCs.
--
--						- MaximalWalkableFloorAngle:	Set the maximum floor angle the NPCs should be able to walk on from a
--														range from 0 to 1. 0 is 0 degrees and 1 is 90 degrees. It is recommended
--														to not set the floor angle too high to make the NPCs look more realistic.
--
--						To restrict the area where the NPCs can walk around, use edges on the floor that have a greater angle than
--						what you set as the maximal walkable floor angle. The edges don't have to be very high, just about the height
--						of the shoes of the NPC. If you can't integrate those edges in the world design, use the example barriers
--						coming with this NPC system. To set them up, turn their visibility on in the properties, after you got them
--						in the right place, turn it off again. If the NPCs ignore the barriers just increase their hight a little.
--
--						3. Further Information
--
--						This NPC system is not totally bug-free! If you spot an error or have a suggestion don't hesitate to tell
